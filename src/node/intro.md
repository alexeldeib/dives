# Introduction

Azure Kubernetes Service builds and manages Kubernetes control planes and nodes 
on behalf of end users. Kubernetes clusters managed fleets of servers, scheduling
workloads to appropriate machines based on available resources and constraints.
Containers use Linux namespaces, cgroups, and chroot to enforce process, network,
filesystem, and privilege isolation between processes.

This is a complex stack. Understanding it takes time.

This book attempts to provide a crash course in Kubernetes and container concepts,
with a particular focus on node functionality and how that relates to AKS.
